                <h3>Peak Mind</h3>
                <p>Taking care of an ailing family member, dealing with someone's demise or just being homebound and witnessing the current state of affairs can impact your mental health. But Peak Mind believes that making your emotions work for you rather than against you is key to successfully passing through the choppy waters. Schedule your first session with Peak Mind to talk to a mentor trained in your counselling topic. Each session is usually priced at Rs 1,999, but the service has been heavily subsidised right now given the need.</p>
                <p>Call: 080-47092334</p>

                <h3>Therapize India</h3>
                <p>Therapize India asked therapy speakers about the barriers to accessing mental healthcare today, and 40 per cent of them claimed that "affordability and a lack of transparency around therapy fees is a big hurdle". And so, the organisation has launched low-cost COVID Support Circles for people dealing with grief, burnout and anxiety. You get access to four sessions for Rs 250, starting next month.</p>
